Meteorite Landings With d3

I used geoJSON to provide world map data.

The meteorite landing data is from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FreeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json


Zoom in and out with mouse scroll. Or zoom in with double-click. The center of the red circles are meteorite landings. A larger circle indicates a larger mass. Hover mouse on a red circle to see details about the meteorite.
